	<h2>Principles of Calm Technology</h2>
	<h5>from <a href="http://www.calmtech.com" target="_blank">calmtech.com</a></h5>
	<strong>I. Technology should require the smallest possible amount of attention</strong>
	<br>a. Technology can communicate, but doesn’t need to speak.<br>
	b. Create ambient awareness through different senses.<br>
	c. Communicate information without taking the wearer out of their environment or task.</p><p>
	<strong>II. Technology should inform and create calm</strong><br>
	a. A person's primary task should not be computing, but being human.<br>
	b. Give people what they need to solve their problem, and nothing more.</p><p>
	<strong>III. Technology should make use of the periphery</strong>
	<br>a. A calm technology will move easily from the periphery of our attention, to the center, and back.<br>
	b. The periphery is informing without overburdening.</p><p>
	<strong>IV. Technology should amplify the best of technology and the best of humanity</strong>
	<br>a. Design for people first.<br>
	b. Machines shouldn't act like humans.<br>
	c. Humans shouldn't act like machines.<br>
	d. Amplify the best part of each.</p><p>
	<strong>V. Technology can communicate, but doesn’t need to speak</strong>
	<br>a. Does your product need to rely on voice, or can it use a different communication method?<br>
	b. Consider how your technology communicates status.</p><p>
	<strong>VI. Technology should work even when it fails</strong>
	<br>a. Think about what happens if your technology fails.<br>
	b. Does it default to a usable state or does it break down completely?</p><p>
	<strong>VII. The right amount of technology is the minimum needed to solve the problem</strong>
	<br>a. What is the minimum amount of technology needed to solve the problem?<br>
	b. Slim the feature set down so that the product does what it needs to do and no more.</p><p>
	<strong>VIII. Technology should respect social norms</strong>
	<br>a. Technology takes time to introduce to humanity.<br>
	b. What social norms exist that your technology might violate or cause stress on?<br>
	c. Slowly introduce features so that people have time to get accustomed to the product.</p>
